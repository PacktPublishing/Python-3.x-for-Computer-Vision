# Python-3.x-for-Computer-Vision

This is the code repository for [Python 3.x for Computer Vision [Video]](https://prod.packtpub.com/in/application-development/python-3x-computer-vision-video-0), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.



## About the Video Course

This video course is a practical guide for developers who want to get started with building computer vision applications using Python 3. The video is divided into six sections: 

<UL>
<LI>	The Fundamentals of Image Processing 
<LI>	Applied Computer Vision
<LI>	Object detection
<LI>	Making Applications Smarter
<LI>	Extending your Capabilities using OpenCV
<LI>	Getting Hands on
</LI></UL>
  
Throughout this video course, three image processing libraries: Pillow, Scikit-Image, and OpenCV are used to implement different computer vision algorithms.

The course will help you build Computer Vision applications that are capable of working in real-world scenarios effectively. Some of the applications that we look at in the course are Optical Character Recognition, Object Tracking and building a Computer Vision as a Service platform that works over the internet.
